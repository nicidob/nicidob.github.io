title: The Greatest Counter-Strike Teams of All-Time
---
In an era of shelter-in-place, we've seen the temporary shutdown of many sports leagues. The biggest sporting news of the day seems to revolve around [discussions of greatness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dance_(TV_series)). These events led me to e-Sports, specifically Counter-Strike, and interest in answering **who were the greatest Counter-Strike teams of all-time?**


Counter-Strike seems [more popular than ever](https://steamcharts.com/app/730), with over a million concurrent players and [large prize pools](https://esportsobserver.com/biggest-esports-2019-prize-pool). The scene has its own [news](https://hltv.org) and betting odds are available from [major betting providers](https://www.pinnacle.com/en/esports/matchups/highlights). It has all the things a traditional sports fan might want, even though the traditional sports and eSports communities seem completely disparate. 

So I decided to take a leaf from Bill _"86' Celtics"_ Simmons' book and ask... Who are the ['11 Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_FC_Barcelona_season), the ['85 Oilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984%E2%80%9385_Edmonton_Oilers_season), the ['39 Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_New_York_Yankees_season), the ['07 Patriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_New_England_Patriots_season), the ['17 Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Golden_State_Warriors_season), and the ['02 UConn Huskies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_Connecticut_Huskies_women%27s_basketball_team) of Counter-Strike. If you don't agree with those as the GOATs, well, that's exactly why this is fun. 

Such breakdowns exist for many sports, but I couldn't find a single list for Counter-Strike. There are annual lists of [player of the year](https://www.hltv.org/news/28749/top-20-players-of-2019-introduction), and regular updates for [current world rankings](https://www.hltv.org/ranking/teams/) but what about the all time greats? [Top 50 Players in CS History](https://youtu.be/yTu1ODceGn4) (2014) has 9M+ YouTube views. But a list of the greatest teams? I guess I have to make my own. 

We'll follow an approach that FiveThirtyEight took for [baseball](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-mlb/), [basketball](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/), and [football](
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nfl/). This consists of building an imperfect quantitative rating, and skip having to actually watch thousands of hours of gameplay to make a more refined decision.

## How the ratings work
We'll be building a basic [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). I've written about the [technical details before](https://nicidob.github.io/nba_elo/), so refer to those for more information. In layman's terms: everyone's rating is represented by a single number. When a team beats another, the winner takes points from the loser; the more unlikely the victory, the more points get exchanged. In absurdly technical jargon, Elo is an [online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm) approximation to [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) using [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law) [proportional control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_control); the conservation implies that the regression version of this task is solving for the [Rayleigh quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_quotient). There, glad I got that out of the way. 

So how to do we get all the matches? We used an export of [Liquipedia](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Main_Page), which has Counter-Strike games going back to 2000. Each team maintains a seperate rating for each game (Source, 1.6, GO). The dataset is incomplete & not uniformly sampled (more recent tournaments are better documented), but I was able to parse about 91,000 matchups, which should be good enough to understand the landscape. All editions of Counter-Strike are combined and treated equally. 

I setup a fairly general Elo algorithm with a half-dozen free parameters. Then I [optimized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative-free_optimization) those parameters. Specifically, I  maximized the [log-likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Logarithmic_scoring_rule) of future match predictions. In what cases? The scoring function was \\( \sum_i T_i \log(p_i)  (r_A + r_B) \\) where \\(p_i\\) is the predicted probability of the true winner, \\(T_i\\) was a multiplier to give higher tier and LAN events higher weight. \\(r_A\\) and \\(r_B\\) are the ratings of the teams, to focus on correctly predicting matchups between top teams. 

Some examples of the final settings: if teams had a 50% chance of winning an S-Tier LAN and won 2-1, they would swap 8 points, 80%/20% winners would see 2 points (if 80% winner won) or 20 points (if 20% winner won). If the the win was 2-1, it'd be 6, 1 and 17 points in the previous 3 examples. Online A-Tier events ignore margin of victory, and all A-Tier events tend to be worth less points. The formula is \\( p_{l}^2  ( (w)^2 A_{\text{Tier},\text{LAN}} + B_{\text{Tier},\text{LAN}})\\) with \\( p_{l}\\) being the match loser's predicted winning probability, \\( w\\) being the % of maps won, and \\( A\\) \\( B\\) being constants with different values for each the four combinations of On/Offline and S/A-Tier. All of these values (including squaring the probability) came from optimizing the objective function above. 

## The highest Elo peaks by Counter-Strike Teams
Without further ado, here's the top 20 teams by peak Elo

I merge teams with similar rosters in adjacent years, so 2018 Astralis (1999) isn't 2nd on the list but grouped with 2019 Astralis. Likewise 2011 SK (1933) is grouped with their 2012 year. In general, Scandinavian teams dominate the top 20, and only one American roster made the list. 

Some of these peaks last several years. Some have high roster overlap, as SoloMid in 2015 looks a lot like Astralis in 2019. Sometimes cores span multiple teams, as GeT_RiGhT and f0rest dominate from 2009 to 2014 being on fnatic, SK and NiP. karrigan shows up four times. NAVI and fnatic climb to the top several times with different rosters. 

I particularly loved the [Golden Five](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Golden_Five). I grouped them across several clan tags (AGAiN, ESC, MYM), but climb fast particularly as Frag eXecutors, formed on Feb 2010 and lasting only 20 months. In that short span, they place top 4 in 6 S-Tier events and 6 A-Tier events, ending with 1st place in WEG 2011 (2:1 over SK) in August and 1st place in SEC 2011 (2:0 over NAVI) in October. A few months later (as ESC), they win WCG (over SK) and then IEM IV (over NAVI). Those SK and NAVI rosters both made the list above.

Each of these teams deserves at least a few words, some analysis, and maybe even a highlight real. Sadly, I don't have the time right now (but can collaborate, contact me!). But I will make some hasty graphs

These teams peak, by definition, in tournaments that they lost. A peak Elo is when that team was the biggest favorite. Being the peak, losses must surely have followed.

## Top Teams in June 2020
At the time of writing, the top 12 teams by Elo are

| Team     | Elo  |   | Team      | Elo  |
|----------|------|---|-----------|------|
| Astralis | 1860 |   | Liquid    | 1731 |
| FaZe     | 1801 |   | NAVI      | 1720 |
| G2       | 1796 |   | NiP       | 1713 |
| Vitality | 1781 |   | Lions     | 1707 |
| mouz     | 1778 |   | FURIA     | 1700 |
| fnatic   | 1761 |   | EG        | 1644 |

11 of the 12 match the [current HLTV Rankings](https://www.hltv.org/ranking/teams/2020/june/1), which is a minor success.

## The 5 Best Counter-Strike Teams of Every Year

To find a few more gems, I'll list the top 5 teams in every year. These use a [quadratic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM-GM-AM-QM_inequalities) of the team's Elo score across all of their Elo updates that year. The choice of quadratic mean should bias these towards their larger results.

* **2000**	clanz (1540), dop (1538), eyeballers (1527), soa (1525), syndicate (1525)
* **2001**	nip (1632), soa (1602), sk (1585), clanz (1578), mtw (1574)
* **2002**	mtw (1649), soa (1608), sk (1598), lnd (1592), eolithic (1592)
* **2003**	sk (1772), team9 (1689), mtw (1686), mouz (1644), eolithic (1637)
* **2004**	sk (1850), mibr (1683), mouz (1678), titans (1659), eyeballers (1658)
* **2005**	sk (1747), mouz (1736), eyeballers (1709), noa (1676), 4kings (1667)
* **2006**	nip (1803), fnatic (1740), mouz (1725), complexity (1720), sk (1707)
* **2007**	fnatic (1809), nip (1750), pentagram (1736), sk (1715), noa (1714)
* **2008**	sk (1795), fnatic (1776), mouz (1766), mibr (1731), mtw (1714)
* **2009**	mtw (1856), fnatic (1788), mouz (1782), sk (1777), mibr (1761)
* **2010**	fnatic (1855), mtw (1808), sk (1791), vg (1746), mouz (1743)
* **2011**	goldenfive (1888), sk (1873), navi (1859), vg (1847), fnatic (1810)
* **2012**	sk (1944), goldenfive (1912), navi (1886), vg (1886), fnatic (1866)
* **2013**	nip (1855), vg (1727), tyloo (1664), mouz (1599), fnatic (1599)
* **2014**	nip (1782), fnatic (1737), vp (1686), ldlc (1683), navi (1663)
* **2015**	fnatic (1849), ldlc (1809), vp (1777), tsm (1747), navi (1745)
* **2016**	fnatic (1849), navi (1779), tsm (1766), vp (1759), nip (1739)
* **2017**	astralis (1783), sk (1780), faze (1749), vp (1721), navi (1706)
* **2018**	astralis (1900), faze (1819), sk (1777), navi (1740), mouz (1730)
* **2019**	astralis (1947), tl (1884), navi (1751), faze (1750), mouz (1745)


Here we see Norwegian teams (eolithic, team9), North American teams (dop, complexity), a South American team (mibr), a Chinese team (TYLOO) and a Russian team (virtus.pro).  These teams even have multiple top-5 appearances and so they probably qualify for some consideration as _"the best Counter-Strike teams ever"_. The sustained success of NAVI (top5 from 2011 to 2020 all but once) deserves some note. Some teams (Team3D, EG) make the top 10 multiple times but never the top5. Mousesports makes the top 5 nearly every year from 2003 thru 2010. Other teams had high peaks but didn't sustain their success. Astralis from '17 to '19 and SK from '03 to '05 both manage three years in the top slot (fnatic got close, from '06 to '10 and '14 to '16). 

To gain points in Elo, it requires directly beating good teams on a regular basis. If the European scene has more players, more teams and more competitions, then their best teams would obtain higher Elo scores than the best North American teams playing the same number of games. Using something like [logistic regression](https://nicidob.github.io/nba_elo/) over batches of games may provided a better rating system than Elo, as it wouldn't suffer from this failure. HLTV's system of [assigning points to winners of tournaments](https://www.hltv.org/news/16061/introducing-csgo-team-ranking) also avoids this problem. 

## Conclusion
I'd probably rank the greatest Counter-Strike teams of all time as
1. 2019 Astralis
2. 2013 Ninjas in Pyjamas
3. 2004 SK Gaming
4. 2015 fnatic 
5. 2019 Team Liquid
6. 2011 Golden Five 

**2019 Astralis** has the highest peak Elo (2022) and the highest annual QM Elo (1947). Add long term success in a crowded field and they're a shoe-in for the number 1 position. 

**2013 NiP** is the runner up, as the only other team team to break 1900 aQM and 1950 peak Elo (SK 12 isn't a full season). The core of f0rest and GeT_RiGhT are on the number 1 team during 2010 (fnatic), 2011-12 (sk) and 2013 (nip), while crossing between Counter-Strike 1.6 and Global Offensive. Their 2012 SK season is short but one of the best all time as well, before they move to CS:GO and usher into a new game, and a new era. 

For the third slot, the dominance of **2004 SK** is hard to understate. No one else is at their level and this metric likely understates their dominance. They have three years in number one position and in 2004 they have an unrivaled 150+ point lead on 2nd place.

For fourth slot there are two clear candidates: **2019 Team Liquid** and **2015 fnatic**. Team Liquid has a peak  that only Astralis surpasses, while fnatic has a high peak and sustained success. I'll give fnatic the nod. 

The last slot comes down to four teams playing at the same time: late 2011 to early 2012 SK Gaming, NAVI, fnatic and the Golden Five. They have 3 of the top 5 peak Elo slots and positions 2, 3 and 4 in aQM Elo.  The **2011 Golden Five (as Frag eXecutors & ESC)** have back-to-back, head-to-head finals wins over the NAVI & SK rosters. Twice! They win WEG+WCG over SK and SEC+IEM over NAVI, which were the bigger tournaments of the time. 

The rest of the top 10 seems harder to fill out but good candidates include several CS1.6 teams (2006 NiP, 2009 mTw, 2008 mouz, 2010 fnatic, 2008 SK) and CSGO teams (2015 VP, 2018 FaZe, 2016 NAVI, 2017 SK, 2015 LDLC). As honorable mentions, **VeryGames** is the undisputed champion of CS:Source while **TYLOO** holds the crown for CS:Online. 

 If you thought this was fun and have your own top 10 list, please make it and share!
