title: The Best Counter-Strike Teams of All-Time
---
In an era of shelter-in-place, we've seen the temporary shutdown of many sports leagues. The biggest sporting news seemed to revolve around [discussions of greatness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dance_(TV_series)). The shelter-in-place led me to check in on eSports, specifically Counter-Strike, and ask **who was the great Counter-Strike team of all-time?**. 


Counter-Strike seems [more popular than ever](https://steamcharts.com/app/730), with over a million concurrent players and [large prize pools](https://esportsobserver.com/biggest-esports-2019-prize-pool). The scene has its own [news](https://hltv.org) and betting odds are available from [major betting providers](https://www.pinnacle.com/en/esports/matchups/highlights). It has all the things a traditional sports fan might want, even though the traditional sports and eSports communities seem completely disperate. 

So I decided to take a leaf from Bill _"86' Celtics"_ Simmons' book and ask... Who are the ['11 Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_FC_Barcelona_season), the ['85 Oilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984%E2%80%9385_Edmonton_Oilers_season), the ['39 Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_New_York_Yankees_season), the ['07 Patriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_New_England_Patriots_season), the ['17 Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Golden_State_Warriors_season), and the ['02 UConn Huskies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_Connecticut_Huskies_women%27s_basketball_team) of Counter-Strike. If you don't agree with those as the GOATs, well, that's exactly why this is fun. 

Such breakdowns exist for many sports, but I couldn't find a single list for Counter-Strike. There are annual lists of [player of the year](https://www.hltv.org/news/28749/top-20-players-of-2019-introduction), and regular updates for [current world rankings](https://www.hltv.org/ranking/teams/) but what about the best teams of all time? I guess I have to make my own. 

We'll follow an approach that FiveThirtyEight took for [baseball](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-mlb/), [basketball](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/), and [football](
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nfl/). This consists of building an imperfect quantitative rating, and skip having to actually watch thousands of hours of gameplay to make a more refined decision. 


## How the ratings work
We'll be building a basic [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). I've written about the [technical details before](https://nicidob.github.io/nba_elo/), so refer to those for more information. In layman's terms: everyone's rating is represented by a single number. When a team beats another, the winner takes points from the loser; the more unlikely the victory, the more points get exchanged. In absurdly technical jargon, Elo is an [online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm) approximation to [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) using [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law) [proportional control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_control); the conservation implies that the regression version of this task is solving for the [Rayleigh quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_quotient). There, glad I got that out of the way. 

So how to do we get all the matches? We used an export of [Liquipedia](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Main_Page), which has Counter-Strike games going back to 2000. Specifically, we're using all the A-Tier and S-Tier Tournaments. The dataset is incomplete & not uniformly sampled (more recent tournaments are better documented), but I was able to parse about 16,000 matches, which should be good enough to understand the landscape. 

I setup a fairly general Elo algorithm with a half-dozen free parameters. Then I [optimized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative-free_optimization) those parameters. Specifically, I was looking to maximize the [log-likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Logarithmic_scoring_rule) of my matches. Remember how I said Elo produced a probability? Well I tuned the parameters so that it produced the most accurate predictions. In what cases? Well the scoring function was \\( \sum_i T_i \log(p_i)  (r_A + r_B) \\) where \\(p_i\\) is the predicted probability of the true winner, \\(T_i\\) was a multiplier that assigned 3x multiplier for LAN matches, and a 3x multiplier for S-Tier instead of A-Tier (9x if it was both S-Tier & LAN). \\(r_A\\) and \\(r_B\\) are the ratings of the teams, to focus on correctly predicting matchups between top teams. 

The resulting Elo coefficients were \\(K_{\text{Off},S} = 13\\) \\(K_{\text{On},S} = 28\\) \\(K_{\text{On},A} = 9\\), \\(K_{\text{Off},A} = 5\\). These coefficients are multiplied by the squared probability of the winner losing (so upsets cause more points swapped). Compared to normal Elo (which doesn't square the probabilities), this results in larger swaps for bigger upsets. That's it! If a team had a 50% chance of winning a match on S-Tier LAN and did, they'd take 3 points from the loser. In comparison, USCF Chess would swap 5 points. 

## The Best Counter-Strike Teams Ever (by Elo peak)
Without further ado, here's the top 23 teams, covering the top 50 seasons.

Astralis and NiP tower above everyone else. One can probably make a decent argument for either being the greatest Counter-Strike team of all time. In general, Scandinavian teams dominate the top 20, and only one American roster has cracked the list. 

Some of these peaks last several years (the top 7 seasons are Astralis 19, NiP 13, Astralis 18, NiP 14, Astralis 20, TL '19, NiP '12). Some of these teams have high roster overlap (VG13, LDLC14, Envy15). Sometimes cores span multiple teams, as GeT_RiGhT and f0rest dominates from 2009 (elo of 1890) to 2014 (elo of 2027) being on fnatic, SK and NiP. SoloMid in 2015 looks a lot like Astralis in 2019. On the other hand, NAVI climbs to the top several times with only a few shared members.   

I particularly loved the [Golden Five](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Golden_Five) instance of Frag eXecutors, who form on Feb 2010 and last only 20 months. In that short span, they place top 4 in 6 S-Tier events and 6 A-Tier events, ending with 1st place finish in WEG 2011 (2:1 over SK, a top 5 team of all time) in August and a 1st place in SEC 2011 (2:0 over NAVI, a top 15 team of all time) in October. They disband (becoming AGAiN) later that month.

Each of these teams deserves at least a few words, some analysis, and maybe even a highlight real. Sadly, I don't have the time right now (but would love to collaborate, contact me!). But I will make some hasty graphs

These teams peak, by definition, in tournaments that they lost. A peak Elo is when that team was the biggest favorite. Being the peak, it must have been downhill from there. 

## Top Teams in June 2020
At the time of writing, the top 12 teams are

| Team     | Elo  |   | Team      | Elo  |
|----------|------|---|-----------|------|
| FaZe     | 1888 |   | fnatic    | 1776 |
| Astralis | 1880 |   | EG        | 1757 |
| Vitality | 1814 |   | NAVI      | 1746 |
| G2       | 1801 |   | MAD Lions | 1742 |
| mouz     | 1799 |   | NiP       | 1731 |
| Liquid   | 1780 |   | FURIA     | 1692 |

11 of the 12 match the [current HLTV Rankings](https://www.hltv.org/ranking/teams/2020/june/1), which is a minor success. 

## The 5 Best Counter-Strike Teams of Every Year

To find a few more gems, I'll the top 5 teams in every year (based on their peak Elo). 
* **2000**	clanz (1592), eyeballers (1581), soa (1570), domainofpain (1565), mtw (1559) 
* **2001**	nip (1766), soa (1673), sk (1669), mtw (1651), legendsneverdie (1636)
* **2002**	mtw (1721), mouz (1657), eolithic (1652), sk (1647), team3d (1630) 
* **2003**	sk (1937), team9 (1816), mtw (1725), mouz (1725), team3d (1703) 
* **2004**	sk (1958), eyeballers (1781), thetitans (1774), mouz (1746), mibr (1732)
* **2005**	sk (1854), mouz (1850), nip (1831), complexity (1783), eyeballers (1776)
* **2006**	nip (1965), sk (1864), fnatic (1852), mouz (1797), complexity (1793)
* **2007**	fnatic (1868), complexity (1824), pentagram (1823), noa (1795) nip (1792)
* **2008**	sk (1889), mouz (1884), mtw (1878), fnatic (1829), mibr (1824)
* **2009**	mtw (1961), fnatic (1889), mouz (1870), sk (1863), meetyourmakers (1809)
* **2010**	fnatic (1941), mtw (1918), sk (1868), navi (1851), vg (1842)
* **2011**	sk (1966), navi (1935), fragexecutors (1909), fnatic (1869), mtw (1859) 
* **2012**	nip (1987), sk (1979), fnatic (1921), navi (1917), vg (1901) 
* **2013**	nip (2068), vg (1939), sk (1917), navi (1904), fnatic (1866) 
* **2014**	nip (2027), fnatic (1925), ldlc (1882), virtus.pro (1851), dignitas (1824)
* **2015**	fnatic (1963), envy (1948), solomid (1928), virtus.pro (1897), ldlc (1869)
* **2016**	fnatic (1960), envy (1935), navi (1885), solomid (1879), ldlc (1872) 
* **2017**	faze (1877), virtus.pro (1860), astralis (1860), sk (1855), navi (1820)
* **2018**	astralis (2050), faze (1898), sk (1847), tl (1810), mouz (1810)
* **2019**	astralis (2079), tl (1988), mouz (1850), navi (1843), faze (1821)

This is a more expansive list in some ways. We see Norwegian teams (eolithic, team9), North American teams (Team3D, complexity), a South American team (MIBR) and a Russian team (virtus.pro). These teams even have multiple top-5 appearances and so they probably qualify for some consideration as _"the best Counter-Strike teams ever"_.

To gain points in Elo, it requires directly beating good teams on a regular basis. If the European scene has more players, more teams and more competitions, then their best teams would obtain higher Elo scores than the best North American teams playing the same number of games. Using something like [logistic regression](https://nicidob.github.io/nba_elo/) over batches of games may provided a better rating system than Elo, as it wouldn't suffer from this failure. HLTV's system of [assigning points to winners of tournaments](https://www.hltv.org/news/16061/introducing-csgo-team-ranking) also avoids this problem.
