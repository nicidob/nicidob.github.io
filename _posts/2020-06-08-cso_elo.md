title: The Greatest Counter-Strike Teams of All-Time
---
In an era of shelter-in-place, we've seen the temporary shutdown of many sports leagues. The biggest sporting news of the day seems to revolve around [discussions of greatness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Dance_(TV_series)). These events led me to e-Sports, specifically Counter-Strike, and interest in answering **who were the greatest Counter-Strike teams of all-time?**


Counter-Strike seems [more popular than ever](https://steamcharts.com/app/730), with over a million concurrent players and [large prize pools](https://esportsobserver.com/biggest-esports-2019-prize-pool). The scene has its own [news](https://hltv.org) and betting odds are available from [major betting providers](https://www.pinnacle.com/en/esports/matchups/highlights). It has all the things a traditional sports fan might want, even though the traditional sports and eSports communities seem completely disparate. 

So I decided to take a leaf from Bill _"86' Celtics"_ Simmons' book and ask... Who are the ['11 Barcelona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9311_FC_Barcelona_season), the ['85 Oilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984%E2%80%9385_Edmonton_Oilers_season), the ['39 Yankees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_New_York_Yankees_season), the ['07 Patriots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007_New_England_Patriots_season), the ['17 Warriors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Golden_State_Warriors_season), and the ['02 UConn Huskies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001%E2%80%9302_Connecticut_Huskies_women%27s_basketball_team) of Counter-Strike. If you don't agree with those as the GOATs, well, that's exactly why this is fun. 

Such breakdowns exist for many sports, but I couldn't find a single list for Counter-Strike. There are annual lists of [player of the year](https://www.hltv.org/news/28749/top-20-players-of-2019-introduction), and regular updates for [current world rankings](https://www.hltv.org/ranking/teams/) but what about the all time greats? [Top 50 Players in CS History](https://youtu.be/yTu1ODceGn4) (2014) has 9M+ YouTube views. But a list of the greatest teams? I guess I have to make my own. 

We'll follow an approach that FiveThirtyEight took for [baseball](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-mlb/), [basketball](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nba/), and [football](
https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/complete-history-of-the-nfl/). This consists of building an imperfect quantitative rating, and skip having to actually watch thousands of hours of gameplay to make a more refined decision.

## How the ratings work
We'll be building a basic [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system). I've written about the [technical details before](https://nicidob.github.io/nba_elo/), so refer to those for more information. In layman's terms: everyone's rating is represented by a single number. When a team beats another, the winner takes points from the loser; the more unlikely the victory, the more points get exchanged. In absurdly technical jargon, Elo is an [online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_algorithm) approximation to [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) using [conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_law) [proportional control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_control); the conservation implies that the regression version of this task is solving for the [Rayleigh quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_quotient). There, glad I got that out of the way. 

So how to do we get all the matches? We used an export of [Liquipedia](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Main_Page), which has Counter-Strike games going back to 2000. Specifically, we're using all the A-Tier and S-Tier Tournaments. The dataset is incomplete & not uniformly sampled (more recent tournaments are better documented), but I was able to parse about 16,000 matches, which should be good enough to understand the landscape. All editions of Counter-Strike are combined and treated equally. 

I setup a fairly general Elo algorithm with a half-dozen free parameters. Then I [optimized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative-free_optimization) those parameters. Specifically, I  maximized the [log-likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoring_rule#Logarithmic_scoring_rule) of future match predictions. In what cases? The scoring function was \\( \sum_i T_i \log(p_i)  (r_A + r_B) \\) where \\(p_i\\) is the predicted probability of the true winner, \\(T_i\\) was a multiplier that assigned 3x multiplier for LAN matches, and a 3x multiplier for S-Tier instead of A-Tier (9x if it was both S-Tier & LAN). \\(r_A\\) and \\(r_B\\) are the ratings of the teams, to focus on correctly predicting matchups between top teams. 

Some examples of the final settings: if teams had a 50% chance of winning an S-Tier LAN and won 2-1, they would swap 8 points, 80%/20% winners would see 2 points (if 80% winner won) or 20 points (if 20% winner won). If the the win was 2-1, it'd be 6, 1 and 17 points in the previous 3 examples. Online A-Tier events ignore margin of victory, and all A-Tier events tend to be worth less points. The formula is \\( p_{l}^2  ( (w)^2 A_{\text{Tier},\text{LAN}} + B_{\text{Tier},\text{LAN}})\\) with \\( p_{l}\\) being the match loser's predicted winning probability, \\( w\\) being the % of maps won, and \\( A\\) \\( B\\) being constants with different values for each the four combinations of On/Offline and S/A-Tier. All of these values (including squaring the probability) came from optimizing the objective function above. 

## The highest Elo peaks by Counter-Strike Teams
Without further ado, here's the top 20 teams by peak Elo

I merge teams with similar rosters in adjacent years, so 2018 Astralis (1967) isn't 2nd on the list but grouped with 2019 Astralis. Likewise 2013 NiP (1949) is grouped with their 2014 year. Otherwise, the top four slots would be held by those two teams. In general, Scandinavian teams dominate the top 20, and only one American roster made the list. 

Some of these peaks last several years. Some have high roster overlap, as SoloMid in 2015 looks a lot like Astralis in 2019. Sometimes cores span multiple teams, as GeT_RiGhT and f0rest dominate from 2009 to 2014 being on fnatic, SK and NiP. karrigan shows up four times. NAVI and fnatic climb to the top several times with different rosters. 

I particularly loved the [Golden Five](https://liquipedia.net/counterstrike/Golden_Five). I grouped them across several clan tags (AGAiN, ESC, MYM), but climb fast particularly as Frag eXecutors, formed on Feb 2010 and lasting only 20 months. In that short span, they place top 4 in 6 S-Tier events and 6 A-Tier events, ending with 1st place in WEG 2011 (2:1 over SK) in August and 1st place in SEC 2011 (2:0 over NAVI) in October. A few months later (as ESC), they win WCG (over SK) and then IEM IV (over NAVI). Those SK and NAVI rosters both made the list above.

Each of these teams deserves at least a few words, some analysis, and maybe even a highlight real. Sadly, I don't have the time right now (but can collaborate, contact me!). But I will make some hasty graphs

These teams peak, by definition, in tournaments that they lost. A peak Elo is when that team was the biggest favorite. Being the peak, losses must surely have followed.

## Top Teams in June 2020
At the time of writing, the top 12 teams by Elo are

| Team     | Elo  |   | Team      | Elo  |
|----------|------|---|-----------|------|
| Astralis | 1849 |   | NAVI      | 1734 |
| FaZe     | 1806 |   | Liquid    | 1728 |
| Vitality | 1761 |   | MAD Lions | 1694 |
| G2       | 1756 |   | NiP       | 1681 |
| mouz     | 1756 |   | FURIA     | 1681 |
| fnatic   | 1744 |   | EG        | 1627 |

11 of the 12 match the [current HLTV Rankings](https://www.hltv.org/ranking/teams/2020/june/1), which is a minor success.

## The 5 Best Counter-Strike Teams of Every Year

To find a few more gems, I'll list the top 5 teams in every year. These use a [quadratic mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HM-GM-AM-QM_inequalities) of the team's Elo score across all of their Elo updates that year. The choice of quadratic mean should bias these towards their larger results.

* **2000**	clanz (1540), dop (1539), eyeballers (1528), soa (1527), syndicate (1526)
* **2001**	nip (1634), soa (1605), sk (1586), mtw (1583), clanz (1580)
* **2002**	mtw (1650), soa (1607), sk (1600), eolithic (1585), dop (1579)
* **2003**	sk (1759), team9 (1708), mtw (1683), mouz (1640), soa (1637)
* **2004**	sk (1846), mouz (1680), thetitans (1680), mibr (1650), eyeballers (1647)
* **2005**	sk (1757), mouz (1740), eyeballers (1704), noa (1677), 4kings (1666)
* **2006**	nip (1795), fnatic (1735), complexity (1720), mouz (1717), sk (1702)
* **2007**	fnatic (1788), pentagram (1741), complexity (1738), nip (1724), noa (1713)
* **2008**	sk (1770), mouz (1754), fnatic (1753), complexity (1746), mtw (1718)
* **2009**	mtw (1837), fnatic (1773), mouz (1769), sk (1765), mibr (1734)
* **2010**	fnatic (1830), mtw (1793), sk (1772), mouz (1733), vg (1713)
* **2011**	goldenfive (1866), sk (1842), navi (1830), vg (1792), fnatic (1786)
* **2012**	sk (1913), navi (1855), goldenfive (1853), fnatic (1853), vg (1820)
* **2013**	nip (1903), vg (1827), fnatic (1798), navi (1758), tyloo (1735)
* **2014**	nip (1803), fnatic (1774), teamldlc (1711), virtus.pro (1710), navi (1695)
* **2015**	fnatic (1854), teamldlc (1822), virtus.pro (1788), navi (1738), envy (1731)
* **2016**	fnatic (1845), navi (1769), solomid (1766), virtus.pro (1755), envy (1739)
* **2017**	astralis (1764), sk (1758), faze (1727), virtus.pro (1706), navi (1698)
* **2018**	astralis (1875), faze (1797), sk (1745), navi (1726), mouz (1709)
* **2019**	astralis (1924), tl (1861), navi (1734), faze (1730), mouz (1727)
* **2020**	astralis (1905), mouz (1803), tl (1783), faze (1783), navi (1780)

Here we see Norwegian teams (eolithic, team9), North American teams (dop, complexity), a South American team (mibr), a Chinese team (TYLOO) and a Russian team (virtus.pro). These teams even have multiple top-5 appearances and so they probably qualify for some consideration as _"the best Counter-Strike teams ever"_. The sustained success of complexity (top5 from 2006 to 2008) deserves some note. Team3D just missed the cutoff, being 6th in '03, '04 and '06. Mousesports makes the top 5 nearly every year from 2004 to 2010. Other teams had high peaks but didn't sustain their success (envy gets a 9th all-time nod but their best annual finish is 4th). Astralis from '17 to '19 and SK from '03 to '05 both manage three years in the top slot (fnatic got close, multiple times). 

To gain points in Elo, it requires directly beating good teams on a regular basis. If the European scene has more players, more teams and more competitions, then their best teams would obtain higher Elo scores than the best North American teams playing the same number of games. Using something like [logistic regression](https://nicidob.github.io/nba_elo/) over batches of games may provided a better rating system than Elo, as it wouldn't suffer from this failure. HLTV's system of [assigning points to winners of tournaments](https://www.hltv.org/news/16061/introducing-csgo-team-ranking) also avoids this problem. 

## Conclusion
I'd probably rank the greatest Counter-Strike teams of all time as
1. 2019 Astralis
2. 2013 Ninjas in Pyjamas
3. 2004 SK Gaming
4. 2015 fnatic 
5. 2019 Team Liquid
6. 2011 Golden Five 

**2019 Astralis** has the highest peak Elo (1986) and the highest annual QM Elo (1925). Add long term success in a crowded field and they're a shoe-in for the number 1 position. 

**2013 NiP** is the runner up, as the only other team team to break 1900 aQM and 1950 peak Elo (SK 12 isn't a full season). The core of f0rest and GeT_RiGhT are on the number 1 team during 2010 (fnatic), 2011-12 (sk) and 2013 (nip), while crossing between Counter-Strike 1.6 and Global Offensive. 

For the third slot, the dominance of **2004 SK** is hard to understate. No one else is at their level and this metric likely understates their dominance. They have three years in number one position and in 2004 they have an unrivaled 150+ point lead on 2nd place.

For fourth slot there are two clear candidates: **2019 Team Liquid** and **2015 fnatic**. They've the 4th/6th highest aQM and 3rd/6th highest peak Elo. Both had great peaks but fnatic proved themselves for longer, putting together two great back-to-back seasons.

The last slot comes down to three teams playing at the same time: late 2011 to early 2012 SK Gaming, NAVI and the Golden Five. They're in the top for aQM (2nd, 6th and 3rd) and peak Elo (4th, 14th and 6th).  The **2011 Golden Five (as Frag eXecutors & ESC)** have back-to-back, head-to-head finals wins over the NAVI & SK rosters. Twice! They win WEG+WCG over SK and SEC+IEM over NAVI, so they got the last slot.  

The rest of the top 10 seems harder to fill out but good candidates include several CS1.6 teams (2006 NiP, 2009 mTw, 2008 mouz) and CSGO teams (2015 VP, 2018 FaZe). 

 If you thought this was fun and have your own top 10 list, please make it and share!
